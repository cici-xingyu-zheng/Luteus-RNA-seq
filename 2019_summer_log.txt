- The sample S1 to S7 correspond to (confirmed)
 M. naiandinus (S1), M. variegatus transformed (S2-S4), M. variegatus control (S5-S7)
 
- Got the HT-seq results on 06/05; Ron's original code setting, no filtering or merging

##
* transformed txt to csv files using R;
* create a data.frame for all 7 samples' read together;
* create metadata for the samples
* create DE-Seq object
* Determine the size factors to use for normalization
* extract the normalized counts

* Unsupervised clustering analyses: log transformation
* Plot the heatmap and PCA

## continue on 06/07
* Dispersion shrinkage looks normal
* Shrink and plot the MA plot 
* Here we go the result summary:
    out of 41997 with nonzero total read count
    adjusted p-value < 0.05
    LFC > 0 (up)       : 345, 0.82%
    LFC < 0 (down)     : 287, 0.68%
    outliers [1]       : 0, 0%
    low counts [2]     : 7284, 17%
    (mean count < 3)
* do the heat map and volcano plot
