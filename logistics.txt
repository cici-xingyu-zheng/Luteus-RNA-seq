Bowtie 2 

* Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of about 50 up to 100s of characters to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes. 

* Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index (based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform or BWT) to keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome, its memory footprint is typically around 3.2 gigabytes of RAM. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes. Multiple processors can be used simultaneously to achieve greater alignment speed.

* Bowtie 2 outputs alignments in SAM format, enabling interoperation with a large number of other tools (e.g. SAMtools, GATK) that use SAM. Bowtie 2 is distributed under the GPLv3 license, and it runs on the command line under Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

* Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) is a text-based format originally for storing biological sequences aligned to a reference sequence developed by Heng Li and Bob Handsaker et al.[1] It is widely used for storing data, such as nucleotide sequences, generated by next generation sequencing technologies.

* A BAM file (.bam) is the binary version of a SAM file.



HTSeq: 

* HTSeq is a Python package that provides infrastructure to process data from high-throughput sequencing assays.

* I think this is the feature that we use: 
Given a SAM file with alignments and a GFF file with genomic features, this script counts how many reads map to each feature.

* GFF/GTF files: The Gene transfer format (GTF) is a file format used to hold information about gene structure. It is a tab-delimited text format based on the general feature format (GFF), but contains some additional conventions specific to gene information.

DESeq2:

* full name: Differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution

* negative binomial reason: 
  In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach.
  Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. 
  DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. 
  Not a straight-forward answer but we can look more into it later.
